I am a PhD student in Biological Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar, working in the Medical Ultrasound Engineering Laboratory (MUSE Lab). My research focuses on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) methods for tissue characterization, including H-scan imaging, backscatter envelope statistics (Nakagami, Burr), and tissue-mimicking phantoms.

**Research interests**
- Quantitative ultrasound for tumor differentiation (ex-vivo and longitudinal studies)
- Microstructural and scattering-based tissue signatures
- Phantom design for validation and benchmarking
