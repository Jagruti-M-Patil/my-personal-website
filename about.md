## Research Profile

I am a PhD scholar in Biological Sciences and Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar, working in the Medical Ultrasound Engineering Laboratory (MUSE Lab) under the guidance of Prof. Karla P. Mercado-Shekhar.

My research focuses on developing advanced quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques for microstructural tissue characterization. I work on envelope statistics (Nakagami, Burr), H-scan imaging, integrated backscatter analysis, and tissue-mimicking phantom validation to enable early and intra-operative detection of pathological changes.
