## Projects

### Ex-vivo brain tissue characterization (GBM vs normal)
- Techniques: envelope statistics (Nakagami/Burr), integrated backscatter, QUS features
- Goal: differentiate tissue types for potential surgical guidance

### Longitudinal oral lesion progression imaging
- Weekly imaging workflow + trend analysis
- Focus: early-stage detection signatures

### Tissue-mimicking phantom development
- Agarose / PVA-based phantoms with controlled scatterers
- Used for validating QUS pipelines and attenuation models
